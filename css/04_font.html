            In CSS, font families are used to specify the typeface of text on a web page. A font family is a collection of fonts that share a common design but may have different weights, styles, or sizes. The most commonly used font families in CSS include Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman, Courier New, and Verdana. To specify a font family in CSS, you can use the "font-family" property followed by the name of the desired font family. For example, to set the font family to Arial, you would use the following CSS code: "font-family: Arial;". It is also possible to specify multiple font families as a fallback option in case the desired font is not available on the user's device. This can be done by separating the font family names with commas. For example: "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;". In this case, if Arial is not available, the browser will try to use Helvetica, and if that is also not available, it will use any available sans-serif font.

            It is important to note that when specifying font families in CSS, it is best practice to include a generic font family as a fallback option. This ensures that if the desired font is not available, the browser can still display the text using a similar font. The generic font families include serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive, and fantasy. For example: "font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;". In this case, if 'Times New Roman' is not available, the browser will use any available serif font. Additionally, it is also possible to use web fonts in CSS by linking to external font files or using services like Google Fonts. This allows for a wider variety of font options and can enhance the overall design of a web page.
