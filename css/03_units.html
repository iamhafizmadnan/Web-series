    THERE ARE 2 TYPES OF UNITS IN CSS
1. Absolute Units
2. Relative Units
1. Absolute Units:
Absolute units are fixed and do not change based on the context. 
They are typically used for print
- cm (centimeters)
- mm (millimeters)
- in (inches)
- px (pixels)
2. Relative Units:
Relative units are flexible and adjust based on the context, 
such as the size of the parent element
- em: Relative to the font-size of the parent element.
 1em is equal to the current font size.
- rem: Relative to the font-size of the root element (html).
 1rem is equal to the font size of the root element.
- %: Relative to the size of the parent element.
- vw: Relative to 1% of the viewport's width.
- vh: Relative to 1% of the viewport's height.

    <h1>Units in CSS</h1>
    <p>
      In CSS, there are two main types of units: absolute units and relative
      units. Absolute units are fixed and do not change based on the context,
      while relative units are flexible and adjust based on the context, such as
      the size of the parent element. Absolute units include cm (centimeters),
      mm (millimeters), in (inches), and px (pixels). Relative units include em
      (relative to the font-size of the parent element), rem (relative to the
      font-size of the root element), % (relative to the size of the parent
      element), vw (relative to 1% of the viewport's width), and vh (relative to
      1% of the viewport's height).
