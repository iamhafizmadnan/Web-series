    <h1>Margin</h1>
    <p>
        Margin is a fundamental aspect of the CSS box model that defines the space
        outside the border of an element. It is used to create separation between
        elements on a webpage, allowing for better visual organization and
        improved readability. Margins can be set using various CSS properties,
        such as margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left, or
        they can be set uniformly using the shorthand property margin.
